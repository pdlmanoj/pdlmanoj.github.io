Writing code is easy. Writing clean, maintainable code is an art.

> "Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares." — Robert C. Martin

## Principles

1.  **Meaningful Names**: Use variable names that reveal intent. `d` is bad. `daysSinceCreation` is good.
2.  **Functions should do one thing**: A function should have a single responsibility.
3.  **Comments**: Code should be self-documenting. Comments should explain *why*, not *what*.
4.  **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Avoid duplication.

Clean code is not about being clever. It's about being clear.

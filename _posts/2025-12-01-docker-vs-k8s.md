**Docker** and **Kubernetes** are two very different technologies that are often confused or thought of as alternatives. In reality, they are complementary.

## Docker

Docker is a containerization platform. It allows you to package your application and its dependencies into a "container" that can run on any machine.

## Kubernetes

Kubernetes (K8s) is a container *orchestration* platform. It is used to manage multiple containers across multiple machines (a cluster).

## Analogy

Think of **Docker** as a shipping container. It holds your goods (code).
Think of **Kubernetes** as the crane and the ship that manages all those containers, ensuring they get to where they need to go and don't fall off.

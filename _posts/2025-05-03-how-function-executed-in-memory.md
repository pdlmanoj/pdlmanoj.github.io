Ever wondered what actually happens under the hood when you run your function code in Python?

In this blog, I am going to walk you through, from the moment you call a function to when it finish its execution what actually happening under the hood. When I learned about this topic, I have made detailed notes to help myself understand this better, and now I‚Äôm excited to share my knowledge with you in this blog,

Let‚Äôs take an example of a function which returns whether a given number is `odd` or `even`.

```python
def check_num(num):
    """This function returns, 
    whether a given number is odd or even"""
    
    if num %2 == 0:
        return 'Even'
    else:
        return 'Odd'

print(check_num(7))
```

Now, let‚Äôs understand how above function gets executed in memory step by step,

## Step 1: Defining the Function

When python reads this line,
```python
def check_num(num):
```

Python doesn‚Äôt starts executing `check_num()` function yet, instead it store the function object in memory, just like saving a recipe for later use. At this point, Python knows there‚Äôs a function `check_num()` which takes a parameter `num`, but yet python doesn‚Äôt run the code written inside our function.

> Think of it as, installing an app in your mobile phone, when installed, an icon appears on your home screen. That icon is like **defining the function**, it‚Äôs ready to run, but the app only starts when you *click* the app icon,  just like **calling the function**.

</div>
<br><br>

## Step 2: Calling the Function

Now, python directly reach to last line,
```python
print(check_num(7))
```

Here, we are calling our function `check_num()`, passing `7` as an argument. When the function call happens, python creates a new `‚Äúbox‚Äù` (separate memory block) for `check_num()` also know as **stack frame**.

Inside this stack frame, python stores the pass argument like this,

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/function-memory-2.png" alt="function-memory-1" width="500"/>
</div>
<br><br>

Now, the `check_num()` function code will be executed **independently**  inside this created stack frame.

You might  have question in you mind,

> ü§î **Why does Python create an separate stack frame for a function, instead of just running it in global frame?**

Suppose your computer **RAM** as a **city** then,
- The `global frame` where your main program runs, **a house inside this city**.
- Then, every time when you call a function, python creates a separate **room inside the house** `(stack frame)`.
- Now, this **room** has its **own `variables`, separate from rest of house.**

> **Note:** If we call more functions, then python will create more rooms, each with their own separate memory block (stack frame)

## Step 3: Executing the Function

Once the `check_num()` function is called, now python begins to executing inside code line by line inside the new created separate stack frame.

```python
    if 7 %2 == 0:
        return 'Even'
    else:
        return 'Odd'
```

Since, `7% 2 ` not equal `to 0`, the condition becomes **false**. So python, skips to `else` block and **return** `‚Äòodd‚Äô` back to main program.

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/function-memory-3.png" alt="function-memory-1" width="500"/>
</div>
<br><br>

At this point, the `check_num()` finished executing and **returns** `‚ÄòOdd‚Äô` to global frame, so python destroys the stack frame created for this function and also the local variables inside the frame, `num` deleted from the memory.

üí° <strong>Interview Question</strong>
<p><strong>1. What's the lifespan of a function in memory?</strong><br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> A function becomes active in memory (stack frame) only during the time the function is called and until it returns a value. Outside of this period, the function does not exist in memory.</p>

<p><strong>2. What about variables lifespan inside a function?</strong><br>
<strong>Answer:</strong> Variables defined inside a function, like <code>num</code>, only exist during the function execution. Once the function execution finishes, these inside variables are automatically destroyed from memory.</p>

## Step 4: Printing the Result

Finally, the `print(check_num(7))` statement becomes, `print(‚ÄòOdd‚Äô)` and the output printed on the screen,

<div align="center">
  <img src="/images/function-memory-5.png" alt="function-memory-1" width="500"/>
</div>
<br><br>

And, this is how your written function code gets executed in memory, from **definition**, to **call**, to **memory allocation**, to **execution** and finally **printing the result**.

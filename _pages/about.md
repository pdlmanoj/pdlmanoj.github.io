I am currently a final-year bachelorâ€™s student at [Taylors University](https://university.taylors.edu.my/en/study/explore-all-programmes/computer-science/undergraduate/bachelor-of-computer-science.html) exploring  topics across machine learning, data visualization, and statistical analysis. 

Currently, I am following a [self-study](https://github.com/pdlmanoj/ds-studyplan) plan to strengthen my core knowledge in data science, build real-world projects, and document my learning journey through blogs.
